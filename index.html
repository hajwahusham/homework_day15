      <h5 class="bg-warning">Coconuts Are More Dangerous Than Sharks</h5>
      <p>
        Pop culture has trained us to fear sharks, but in reality, sharks are
        less dangerous than a falling coconut. That’s right! Falling coconuts
        kill 30 times more humans annually than sharks
      </p>
      <h5 class="bg-warning">Shark Skin Is More Like Teeth Than Fish Scales</h5>
      <p>
        Sharks may look sleek and smooth, but their skin is actually made up of
        tiny v-shaped scales, also called dermal denticles, which are made of an
        inner pulp cavity and an outside layer of dentine, an enamel-like
        material (just like our teeth). With their scales being more similar to
        teeth than typical fish scales when a shark loses a denticle, it can
        actually fossilize over time, just like ancient shark teeth! In addition
        to being just plain cool, these scales also help decrease drag and
        turbulence, allowing sharks to swim faster and more stealthily while
        hunting for prey.
      </p>
      <h5 class="bg-warning">Sharks Don’t Have Vocal Chords</h5>
      <p>
        Despite the soundtracks that follow sharks in the movies, sharks are
        silent creatures. This is because sharks don’t have vocal cords, making
        them unable to make noise like other marine animals such as dolphins,
        whales, or seals.
      </p>
      <h5 class="bg-warning">
        Sharks Can Lose More Than 30,000 Teeth In A Lifetime
      </h5>
      <p>
        Sharks are known for their pearly whites, but did you know that a shark
        can shed more than 30,000 teeth over its lifespan? Unlike humans, who
        have a single set of 32 permanent teeth, when a shark loses a tooth,
        another one will quickly take its place to ensure that these apex
        predators are always prepared for their next meal. If you were to peek
        inside a shark’s mouth, you would notice several rows of teeth behind
        their first row of chompers. These rows of teeth lay flat inside the
        shark’s mouth as a backup until a tooth is shed, and it’s time to fill
        in the gap!
